# Minimal web app

This is a minimal web application, useful during demos & trainings to
understand how environment variables work and how to expose a web application
into the Internet.

If you find it useful, enjoy!

## Environment variables

* ENVIRONMENT contain the environment name that is simply shown in the root
  page of the application
